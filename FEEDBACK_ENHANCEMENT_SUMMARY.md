# SKU Classification Bot - Feedback Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem Statement
When users clicked the dislike button and provided correction details (correct product line code, business unit) and comments, this information was being stored in the feedback database but was **NOT** being included in the Teams notifications. Teams notifications only showed basic prediction details.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Teams Notification Function (`teams_config.py`)
- **Updated**: `send_feedback_notification()` function to accept additional parameters:
  - `correct_product_line` - User's correction for product line code
  - `correct_business_unit` - User's correction for business unit
  - `user_comment` - User's additional comments
- **Enhanced**: Teams message to include correction details for dislike feedback:
  - âœ… Correct Product Line Code (if provided)
  - âœ… Correct Business Unit (if provided)  
  - ðŸ’¬ User Comments (if provided)

#### 2. Updated Feedback Storage (`main.py`)
- **Modified**: `save_feedback()` function call to pass correction details to Teams notification
- **Enhanced**: Both exact match and fuzzy match display functions to include correction data in Teams notifications

#### 3. Data Flow Enhancement
```
User clicks Dislike â†’ Fills correction form â†’ Submits feedback
    â†“
save_feedback() stores data locally AND calls Teams notification
    â†“
Teams notification now includes:
- Original prediction details
- User correction details (if provided)
- User comments (if provided)
```

### Key Features Added

#### For LIKE Feedback:
- Teams notification shows standard prediction details
- Confirms user satisfaction with prediction

#### For DISLIKE Feedback:
- Teams notification shows original prediction details
- **NEW**: Shows user's correct product line code (if provided)
- **NEW**: Shows user's correct business unit (if provided)
- **NEW**: Shows user's comments (if provided)
- Helps identify prediction errors and improvement areas

### Files Modified

1. **`teams_config.py`**:
   - Enhanced `send_feedback_notification()` function
   - Added support for correction details in Teams messages

2. **`main.py`**:
   - Updated `save_feedback()` function call
   - Modified display functions for exact and fuzzy matches

3. **`test_teams_feedback.py`** (NEW):
   - Test script to verify Teams notification functionality
   - Tests both like and dislike scenarios with corrections

### Benefits

1. **Complete Feedback Loop**: Teams notifications now show full user feedback including corrections
2. **Better Model Training Data**: Correction details are captured for retraining
3. **Improved Monitoring**: Teams can see what users think should be the correct classification
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Users know their detailed feedback is being communicated

### Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_teams_feedback.py
```

The test will verify:
- Like feedback notifications work correctly
- Dislike feedback with full corrections work correctly  
- Dislike feedback with partial corrections work correctly

### Usage Example

When a user:
1. Gets a prediction they disagree with
2. Clicks "ðŸ‘Ž Dislike"
3. Selects correct product line code: "2MH"
4. Selects correct business unit: "FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS"
5. Adds comment: "This should be 3D based on volume analysis"

The Teams notification will now show:
- All original prediction details
- âœ… Correct Product Line Code: 2MH
- âœ… Correct Business Unit: FLEXIBLE SOLUTIONS
- ðŸ’¬ User Comments: This should be 3D based on volume analysis

This provides complete visibility into user feedback for model improvement and monitoring.
